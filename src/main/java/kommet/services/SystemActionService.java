 * Services implementing this interface will provide a list of URLs registered with the environment.
 * 
 * The reason why we will have two services implementing it is that one of them will be used during normal
 * system operation and it will make use of injected RequestMappingHandlerMapping. The other one will be a
 * mock service used in tests. We need to have such separation because RequestMappingHandlerMapping is not
 * available in tests and cannot be injected there.
